# Overview

This is the official website for the DOE project Creating a Sea-Level-Enabled E3SM.  It's web address is [https://sle-e3sm.github.io/](https://sle-e3sm.github.io/).

# Usage

Project members should feel free to directly modify the master branch (which is the branch that is rendered to the webpage) as they see fit.  One easy way to do this is via [web-based editing and committing](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).  If error-free, your edits will be automatically incorporated into the website, generally within a few seconds.  If you're feeling cautious you can always clone and configure a local rendering environment, too.

# Layout

The site is based on [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), which is a Github-supported static site generator.  Main pages are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (.md).  You can use Markdown or HTML/CSS in these files, they're pretty flexible.  Template designs are also open to modification by advanced developers. 

The main configuration file is ```_config.yml```.

The landing page is ```index.md```.

Additional pages are added as follows:

1) Create and commit a new ```YOURPAGENAME.md``` file (online or via local clone/create/commit/push).
2) Add YAML header to top of file (see existing \*.md files), including a permalink ID for the page.
3) If you want your page appearing on the top banner, in ```_layouts/default.html```, being careful about upper/lower cases, add: 
```<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/[YOURPAGENAME]">[YOURPAGENAME]</a>.``` to the [list](https://github.com/DOE-ProSPect/DOE-ProSPect.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/default.html#L32) of existing pages.
